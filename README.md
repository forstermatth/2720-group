Build Instructions
  1. To compile the project, use makein the root directory.
  2. The schedtarget builds the production code, while the teststarget builds the testing
code.
  3. To run the tests, execute tests.
  4. To start the program, execute sched.
  

The program takes in a .xml filename as input, and can include relative or absolute paths. We have included a test input file, located at testfiles/demo.xml.
The rapidXML library is included within the project and does not need to be installed on the machine compiling.
